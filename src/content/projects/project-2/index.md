The goal of this bot was to be used with your friends. This project was a side project and also the final project which I submitted for CS50P. By no means is this project bug free or an industry standard, it's purely a passion project I made cause it seemed cool.

Also, one last thing, I made this discord bot usable to others purely by using the code on the own rather than just inviting the bot so it's aimed for intermediate-ish programmers who know how to set up a bot and stuff and it's designed to be used just by a small group of friends so just inviting the same bot won't work hence you'll need to take my source code and add it to your own bot
